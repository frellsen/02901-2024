# *Introduction to Deep Generative Models and EBMs* (DTU PhD course 02901)

This is the material for the *Introduction to Deep Generative Models and energy based models* session at [02901 Advanced Topics in Machine Learning: Physics meets Machine Learning 2024](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02901).

It consists of **slides** on [DGMs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ee4i7L6wAAo3kOPisZmVXoKfdnFcJaw-/view?usp=sharing) and EBMs. We also provide three Jupyter notebooks called `1-VAE.ipynb`, `2-Flow.ipynb`, and `3-EBM.ipynb`. The notebooks run out of the box in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), but it is also fairly easy to run them locally.

Prerequisite for the exercises are:
* The background material presented in the lecture.
* Programming experience in Python using PyTorch.
